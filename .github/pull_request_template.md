## 📣 Please, go through these steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR meets the following requirements:

   a. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches should start with the `fix:`, `feat:`, `refactor:`, `chore:` prefixes.

   b. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).

   c. You have only one commit (if not, squash them into one commit).

3. **After** these steps, you're ready to open a pull request.

   a. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `main` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `develop` instead.

   b. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

   c. Provide a description of your changes.

   d. Assign 1-2 reviewers.
